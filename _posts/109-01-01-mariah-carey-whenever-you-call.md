Love wondered inside
Stronger than you
Stronger than I
And now that it has begun
We cannot turn back
We can only turn into one
I won't ever be
Too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call
And I'm truly inspired
Finding my soul
There in your eyes
And you have opened my heart
And lifted me inside
By showing me yourself, undisguised


And I won't ever be
Too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call
And I will breathe for you each day
Comfort you through all the pain
Gently kiss your fears away
You can turn to me and cry
Always understand that I
Give you all I have inside
Now I won't ever be
Too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
I won't ever be
Too far to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
And be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call
Whenever you call
Whenever you call
