Oh, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

Never had much faith in love or miracles
Never wanna put my heart on the line
But swimming in your world is something spiritual
I'm born again every time you spend the night

'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause you make feel like
I've been locked out of Heaven
For too long, for too long

Yeah, you make feel like
I've been locked out of Heaven
For too long, for too long

Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah

You bring me to my knees, you make me testify
You can make a sinner change his ways
Open up your gates 'cause I can't wait to see the light
And right there is where I wanna stay

'Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise
And it shows, yeah, yeah, yeah

'Cause you make feel like
I've been locked out of Heaven
For too long, for too long

Yeah, you make feel like
I've been locked out of Heaven
For too long, for too long

Oh, yeah
Can I just stay here? Spend the rest of my days here
Oh, yeah
Can I just stay here? Spend the rest of my days here

'Cause you make feel like
I've been locked out of Heaven
For too long, for too long

Yeah, you make feel like
I've been locked out of Heaven
For too long, for too long

Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah
Oh, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
