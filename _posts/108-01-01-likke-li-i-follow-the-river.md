Oh, I beg you: can I follow?
Oh, I ask you: why not always?
Be the ocean, where I unravel.
Be my only, be the water where I'm wading.

You're my river running high.
Run deep. Run wild

[Chorus]
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea, baby, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you,
Dark doom, honey. I follow you

He a message; I'm the runner.
He's the rebel; I'm the daughter waiting for you.

You're my river running high.
Run deep. Run wild

[Chorus]
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea, baby, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you,
Dark doom, honey. I follow you

You're my river running high.
Run deep. Run wild

[Chorus 2x]
I, I follow, I follow you
Deep sea, baby, I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you,
Dark doom, honey. I follow you

[Repeat until end]
I, I follow, I follow you deep sea, baby,
I follow you
I, I follow, I follow you, dark doom, honey,
I follow you
