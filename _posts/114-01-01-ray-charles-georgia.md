Georgia, Georgia, the whole day through
just an old sweet song
that keeps Georgia on my mind
I said Georgia
O I said Georgia
a song, a song of you
comes as sweet and clear as moonlight through the pines

Other arms reach out to me
other eyes smile tenderly
but still in peaceful dreams I see
the road, woo the road leads back to you

I said Georgia, no peace, no peace I find
just an old sweet song
that keeps you Georgia on my mind

Other arms reach out to me
other eyes smile tenderly
but still in peaceful dreams I see


the road, woo the road leads back to you

I said Georgia
no peace, no peace I find
Just that old, sweet song
that keeps you Georgia on my mind
I said Georgia, Georgia, my sweet Georgia
just that old sweet song
that keeps you Georgia on my mind
