Think (think) think (think) think (think)
think (think) think (think) think (think)

You better think (think) think about what you're trying to
do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself
be free

Let's go back, let's go back, let's go way on back when
I didn't even know you, you came to me and too much you
wouldn't take
I ain't no psychiatrist, I ain't no doctor with degree
It don't take too much high IQ's to see what you're doing to
me

You better think (think) think about what you're trying to
do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself
be free

Oh freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, yeah
freedom
Freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, ooh freedom

There ain't nothing you could ask I could answer you but I
won't (I won't)
I was gonna change, but I'm not, to keep doing things I
don't

You better think (think) think about what you're trying to
do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself
be free

People walking around everyday, playing games that they can
score
And I ain't gonna be the loser my way, ah, be careful you
don't lose yours

You better think (think) think about what you're trying to
do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself
be free

You need me (need me) and I need you (don't you know)
Without eachother there ain't nothing people can do
'Till the fall of the night, think about it right now>
Oh freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, yeah
freedom
Freedom (freedom), freedom (freedom), freedom, ooh freedom

There ain't nothing you could ask I could answer you but I
won't (I won't)
I was gonna change, but I'm not, if you're doing things I
don't

You better think (think) think about what you're trying to
do to me
Yeah, think (think, think), let your mind go, let yourself
be free

You need me (need me) and I need you (don't you know)
Without eachother there ain't nothing people can do
'Till the fall of the night, think about it baby>
(Think about - ah me, think about - ah me,
think about - ah me, think about it)
(Think about - ah me, think about - ah me,
think about - ah me, think about it)
(Think about - ah me, think about - ah me,
think about - ah me, think about it)
(Think about - ah me, think about - ah me,
think about - ah me, think about it)
You had better stop and think before you think, think !!
