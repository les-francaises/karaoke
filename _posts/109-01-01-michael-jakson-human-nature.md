Looking out across the night-time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs Get me out into the night-time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way? Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way, I like lovin' this way Looking out across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street If they say, why, why? Tell 'em that is human nature


Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, why, why? Ooh, tell 'em
Why, why does he do me that way? If they say, why, why? Cha cha cha
Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say why, why, why? Ooh, tell 'em
Why, why does he do me that way? If they say, why, why? Ooh, tell 'em
Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, why, why? Da da da
Why, why does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
