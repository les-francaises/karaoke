I never meant 2 cause U any sorrow
I never meant 2 cause U any pain
I only wanted one time 2 see U laughing
I only wanted 2 see U laughing in the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted 2 see U bathing in the purple rain

I never wanted 2 be your weekend lover
I only wanted 2 be some kind of friend, hey
Baby, I could never steal U from another
It's such a shame our friendship had 2 end

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
I only wanted 2 see U underneath the purple rain



Honey, I know, I know, I know times are changin'
It's time we all reach out 4 something new, that means U 2
U say U want a leader, but U can't seem 2 make up your mind
I think U better close it and let me guide U 2 the purple rain

Purple rain, purple rain
Purple rain, purple rain
If U know what I'm singin' about up here, come on raise your hand
Purple rain, purple rain
I only want 2 see U, only want 2 see U in the purple rain
