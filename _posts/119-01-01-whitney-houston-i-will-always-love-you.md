If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go, but I know
I'll think of you every step of the way
And I will always love you
I will always love you

You, my darling, you, hmm
Bittersweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So, goodbye
Please, don't cry
We both know I'm not what you, you need
And I will always love you
I will always love you

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of
And I wish to you joy and happiness
But above all this, I wish you love

And I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you

You
Darling, I love you
Ooh, I'll always
I'll always love you
