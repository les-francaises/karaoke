Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul Â‘cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
But clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss up on my cheek, he's here reluctantly
As if I'm gonna be out late I say I won't be long just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go


And we know it very well Â‘Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun
And put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this
Anymore, anymore And I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
A murderer, no no no
Yeah
