I did my best
But I guess my best wasn't good enough
Cause here we are back where we were before
Seems nothing ever changes
We're back to being strangers
Wondering if we ought to stay or head on out the door
Just once
Can't we figure out what we keep doin' wrong
Why we never last for very long
What are we doin' wrong?
Just once
Can't we find a way to finally make it right
To make the magic last for more than just one night
If we could just get to it
I know we could break through it
I gave my all
But I think my all may have been too much
Cause lord knows we're not getting' anywhere
It seems at times with all we've got
We haven't got a prayer


Just once
Can't we figure out what we keep doin' wrong
Why the good times never last for long
Where are we going wrong?
Just once
Can't we find a way to finally make it right
To make the magic last for more than just one night
I know we could break through it
If we could just get to it
Just once
I
