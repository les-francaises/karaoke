Now You Say You're Lonely,
You Cried A Long Night Through.
Well, You Can Cry My A River,
Cry Me A River:
I Cried A River Over You.

And Now You Say You're Sorry,
For Bein' So Untrue.
Well, You Can Cry Me A River,
Cry Me A River:
I Cried A River Over You.

You Drove Me, Nearly Drove Me Out Of My Head,
While You Never Shed A Tear.|
Remember, I Remember All That You Said.
Told Me Love Was Too Plebian,
Told Me You Were Through With Me.

An' Now You Say You Love Me,
Just To Prove You Do,


Come On An' Cry Me A River, Cry Me A River,
I Cried A River Over You.

I Cried A River Over You.
I Cried A River Over You.
I Cried A River Over You.
